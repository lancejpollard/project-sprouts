For SWC files generated with the compc compiler, set this value to true, unless the target SWC file is an RSL. In that case, set the debug option to false.

For information about the command-line debugger, see Using the Command-Line Debugger (http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/2/docs/00001540.html#181846).

The max-execution-time value specifies the maximum duration, in seconds, that an ActionScript event handler can execute before Flash Player assumes that it is hung, and aborts it. The default value is 60 seconds. You cannot set this value above 60 seconds.

Example:

The default location of the files is the /generated subdirectory, which is directly below the target MXML file. If the /generated directory does not exist, the compiler creates one.

The default names of the primary generated class files are filename-generated.as and filename-interface.as.

The default value is false.\nThis is an advanced option.

        p.description =<<EOF
Links SWC files to the resulting application SWF file. The compiler only links in those classes for the SWC file that are required.

The default value of the library-path option includes all SWC files in the libs directory and the current locale. These are required.

To point to individual classes or packages rather than entire SWC files, use the source-path option.

If you set the value of the library-path as an option of the command-line compiler, you must also explicitly add the framework.swc and locale SWC files. Your new entry is not appended to the library-path but replaces it.

You can use the += operator to append the new argument to the list of existing SWC files.

In a configuration file, you can set the append attribute of the library-path tag to true to indicate that the values should be appended to the library path rather than replace it.

Specifies the location of the configuration file that defines compiler options.

If you specify a configuration file, you can override individual options by setting them on the command line.

All relative paths in the configuration file are relative to the location of the configuration file itself.

Use the += operator to chain this configuration file to other configuration files.

The XML file uses the same syntax as the one produced by the link-report option. For more information on the report, see Examining linker dependencies (http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/2/docs/00001394.html#211202).

This option provides compile-time link checking for external components that are dynamically linked.

You must also include the parent directory of the individual locale directories, plus the token {locale}, in the source-path; for example:

mxmlc -locale en_EN -source-path locale/{locale} -file-specs MainApp.mxml

Specifies the output path and filename for the resulting file. If you omit this option, the compiler saves the SWF file to the directory where the target file is located.

The default SWF filename matches the target filename, but with a SWF file extension.

If you use a relative path to define the filename, it is always relative to the current working directory, not the target MXML application root.

Specifies a list of run-time shared libraries (RSLs) to use for this application. RSLs are dynamically-linked at run time.

You specify the location of the SWF file relative to the deployment location of the application. For example, if you store a file named library.swf file in the web_root/libraries directory on the web server, and the application in the web root, you specify libraries/library.swf.

Adds directories or files to the source path. The Flex compiler searches directories in the source path for MXML or AS source files that are used in your Flex applications and includes those that are required at compile time.

You can use wildcards to include all files and subdirectories of a directory.

To link an entire library SWC file and not individual classes or directories, use the library-path option.

The source path is also used as the search path for the component compiler's include-classes and include-resource-bundles options.

You can also use the += operator to append the new argument to the list of existing source path entries.
