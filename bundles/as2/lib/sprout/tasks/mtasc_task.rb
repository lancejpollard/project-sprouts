  end

  # Compile sources using the Motion Twin ActionScript Compiler (MTASC[http://www.mtasc.org]).
  # 
  # Like standard Rake file tasks, the name given to the MTASCTask instance should be the
  # file that the task is epected to create. This value can be overridden in the configuration
  # block by using the -output parameter. 
  #
  #   mtasc 'bin/SomeProject.swf' do |t|
  #     t.main = true
  #     t.header = '800:600:24'
  #     t.input = 'src/SomeProject.as'
  #   end
  #
  # The above MTASCTask can be aliased for easier typing on the command line as follows:
  # 
  #   desc "Compile SomeProject.swf"
  #   task :compile => 'bin/SomeProject.swf'
  #
  # If the MTASCTask has a SWFMillTask as a prerequisite, it will automatically set that task output
  # as the value of the -swf paramter. Additionally, when MTASC pulls in an existing SWF file
  # you no longer need to define the -header parameter as it will use the dimensions and frame rate
  # found in the loaded SWF file. If the -header parameter is set, it will override
  # whatever settings are in the loaded SWF. Following is a short example:
  #
  #   swfmill 'bin/SomeProjectSkin.swf' do |t|
  #     t.input = 'assets/skin'
  #   end
  # 
  #   mtasc 'bin/SomeProject.swf' => 'bin/SomeProjectSkin.swf' do |t|
  #     t.main = true
  #     t.input = 'src/SomeProject.as'
  #   end
  #
  # Any LibraryTask instances that are added as prerequisites to the MTASCTask will be automatically
  # added to the class_path in the order they are declared as prerequisites.
  #
  # The following example will add the imaginary libraries :somelib, :otherlib and :yourlib to the class_path in that order.
  #
  #   library :yourlib
  #   library :otherlib
  #   library :somelib
  #
  #   mtasc 'bin/SomeProjectRunner.swf' => [:somelib, :otherlib, :yourlib] do |t|
  #     t.main = true
  #     t.header = '800:600:24'
  #     t.input = 'src/SomeProjectRunner.as'
  #   end
  #
  # <em>At this time, MTASC does not support libraries that are packaged as SWC files. We are considering 
  # adding support for SWC files in the near future, if you're interested in contributing to this 
  # feature, please let us know.</em>

Add a directory path to the class path. This is the list of directories that MTASC will use to look for .as files. You can add as many class_path values as you like. This parameter is an Array, so be sure to append rather than overwrite.

Even though the official MTASC compiler accepts the +cp+ paramter, we have aliased it as +class_path+, you can use either name in your scripts.
